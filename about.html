    <h2><u>Who We Are</u></h2>
    <ul>
    <li><p>Smart Tutors is a team of passionate educators dedicated to helping students achieve their academic goals.</li></p>
    <li><p>We provide personalized learning, expert guidance, and interactive lessons for all subjects.</li></p>
    <li><p>Our mission is to make learning effective, enjoyable, and accessible for every student.</li></p>
  </ul>
    <br>
    <p>
      <b><u>--->Our Beliefs</u></b><br>
We believe that every student deserves access to a personal tutor — someone who can guide, encourage, and inspire them to reach their full potential. This belief is at the heart of everything we do. We are committed to advancing opportunity and achievement for all learners, regardless of background or circumstance.

To make that mission a reality, we partner with thousands of private and public institutions, including colleges and universities, K–12 schools and districts, and libraries nationwide to provide 24/7, on-demand tutoring; high-dosage tutoring; test preparation, and homework help in nearly 250 subjects.

Our mission is simple yet powerful: to instill hope, advance equity, and catalyze achievement by delivering personalized, empowering, and effective academic and professional support for learners of every age and stage — from kindergarten through graduate school, career development, and lifelong learning.

With nearly three decades of experience supporting students, educators, families, and institutions, we have helped increase student success and persistence rates while building confidence and skills. Our results speak for themselves: 95% of learners would recommend Tutor.com to a friend, and 97% say they are glad their institution offers our services. We are honored to be part of each learner's educational journey — empowering our partners to scale human connection and deliver personalized support anytime, anywhere.
<br><br>
<b><u>--->Our Story</u></b><br>
In 1998, a small team of passionate education and technology pioneers had a big idea — and a great URL. They envisioned a future where students could connect with expert tutors anytime, anywhere through the power of the internet. Driven by that vision, they assembled a team of dedicated tutors and launched one of the first interactive online classrooms, laying the foundation for what would become Tutor.com™.

By 2000,Smart Tutor was officially incorporated in Delaware and began partnering with institutions nationwide to ensure that students from all socioeconomic backgrounds had access to high-quality, personalized tutoring and homework help — day or night, from any internet-enabled device.

In 2014, Tutor.com expanded its impact by acquiring The Princeton Review®, a global leader in education services, adding industry-leading test preparation to its growing suite of offerings.

Today, as a U.S.–owned and operated company headquartered in New York, we proudly build on our nearly three decades of innovation and impact. Each year, we deliver approximately two million tutoring, homework help, and test preparation sessions — all with one clear goal: to help every student achieve their highest potential.
<br><br>
<b><u>--->Our Tutors</u></b><br>
Each year, more than 200,000 aspiring tutors apply to join Tutor.com — but only the most exceptional are selected. Every candidate undergoes a rigorous, multi-step evaluation process to demonstrate deep subject-matter expertise, proven teaching effectiveness, and full mastery of our interactive online classroom.

Tutors must also pass a comprehensive third-party background check. On average, just 1.2% of applicants successfully complete the process and join our elite tutoring team. Through selective recruitment, ongoing quality assurance, and continuous professional development, we ensure that every Tutor.com educator consistently delivers engaging, personalized, and highly effective instruction — empowering learners to succeed and thrive.
